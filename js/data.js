        narrative: "As the first light kisses the ancient stone, the Skala de la Ville awakens. Here, the salt of the Atlantic spray mingles with the centuries-old scent of thuya wood. The cry of gulls is the only music, a timeless score for the slow dance of fishing boats on the horizon.",

        narrative: "To enter the Fes medina at noon is to step out of time. Light filters through reed-covered alleys, illuminating a million moments at once. The air is thick with the scent of spices, the clang of the coppersmith's hammer, and the murmur of a thousand conversations. It is not a place you see, but a place you feel in your bones.",

        narrative: "As the sun bleeds across the horizon, the Sahara performs its final, silent act of the day. The dunes, sculpted by wind and time, turn from gold to rose to deep violet.
